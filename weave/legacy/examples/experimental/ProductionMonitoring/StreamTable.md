# Weave StreamTable

Log and explore some basic StreamTables now in the [interactive notebook version](../ProductionMontoring/stream_table_api.ipynb) of these docs.

A Weave StreamTable object enables continuous streaming of data from an application or service to W&B. You can append data repeatedly to the same StreamTable object with `.log([your data rows])` and build dynamic visualizations from the streaming data, like example to recognize MNIST digits hand-drawn in an [interactive Jupyter notebook](../ProductionMonitoring/ProductionMonitoringConceptualOverview.ipynb).

## Create a StreamTable

The only required argument to create a StreamTable is the name of the StreamTable object.

```python
from weave.legacy.weave.monitoring import StreamTable
st = StreamTable("my_entity_name/my_project_name/my_table_name")
```

If an entity (W&B username or shared team name) is not provided, this will attempt to default to the current logged-in entity.

## Log data to a StreamTable

Call `.log()` to add rows to a StreamTable:

```python
st.log({"one_column_name" : "value_a", "another_column_name" : 7})
st.log([
    {"one_column_name" : "value_b", "another_column_name" : 19},
    {"one_column_name" : "value_c", "another_column_name" : 28},
    {"one_column_name" : "value_d", "another_column_name" : 36}])
```

`.log()` accepts a single dictionary or a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary entry corresponds to one row of the table. In each dictionary, the keys are column names and the values are the corresponding cell values.

## Visualize the StreamTable

The first call to `.log()` will return a Weave Panel URL, where you can view, edit, and save the resulting StreamTable as a Weave Board, of the form:

View data at : https://weave.wandb.ai/?exp=get%28%0A++++%22wandb-artifact%3A%2F%2F%2Fstacey%2Fmesa%2Fmy_stream_table%3Alatest%2Fobj%22%29%0A++.rows

![prodmon_tiny_table](../../../docs/assets/small_stream_table.png)

Subsequent log calls will silently append these rows to the StreamTable instance.

In a notebook, the StreamTable variable on a line by itself will return a Weave Panel view of the StreamTable. The StreamTable will contain all the logged columns and their values, as well as a `timestamp` column indicating when the row was logged. By default, rows will be ordered by oldest first. You can modify a StreamTable Panel from the UI to sort by columns, group by column values, filter for specific ranges or values, etc.

**Note:** If you would like to customize and save a specific view of a StreamTable Panel, open the StreamTable Panel in a new window as a Board and edit/save a Board from this seed panel. There are two options to achieve this:

- via the weave.wandb.ai/?exp=... URL
- via "Open in new tab" arrow button, revealed in the menu when you hover on the right side of a StreamTable panel displayed in the notebok)

![stream_table_from_notebook](../../../docs/assets/stream_table_from_notebook.png)

Continue logging as much data as you like. If you save the StreamTable Panel as a Board, the Board will continue to update as you send more data to the same StreamTable instance.

## StreamTable API Reference

### StreamTable()

Create a StreamTable by providing a table name, with W&B entity (username or team name) and W&B project as prefixes (in the form `entity_name/project_name/table_name`) or separate arguments.

```python
StreamTable(
  table_name: str,
  project_name: typing.Optional[str] = None,
  entity_name: typing.Optional[str] = None
)
```

### .log()

Append rows to the SteamTable. Each row is a dictionary, and `.log()` accepts a single dictionary or a list of dictionaries.

```python
st = StreamTable("stream_table")
st.log({"col_A" : 10, "col_B" : "x"})
st.log([{"col_A" : 20, "col_B" : "y"}, {"col_A" : 30, "col_B" : "z"}])
```

### .rows()

Add this Weave op to the expression at the top of a Weave Panel to show the contents/actual rows of a StreamTable. Without this op, a StreamTable Panel in the UI will only display the entity, project, and table names (and not the row contents of the StreamTable object).

### .finish()

Call `.finish()` to block the user process until all rows and data have been uploaded successfully. This will also wait to display a StreamTable Panel in the notebook UI until all the `.log()` calls have completed (including any downstream processes, e.g. to compute the values of the rows) and have finished writing to the StreamTable instance.

## Usage notes

- **optionally use `.finish()` before viewing the StreamTable**: helpful in cases where you'd like all the rows/logging to complete before viewing the StreamTable. Note that the weave.wandb.ai URL will still show a snapshot of your data at the time it finishes loading â€” you may need to refresh the page to get all the rows.
