"""
This file exposes functions to make the PIL ImageFile thread-safe and revert those changes:
- `apply_threadsafe_patch_to_pil_image`
- `undo_threadsafe_patch_to_pil_image`

There is a discussion here: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/4848#issuecomment-671339193 in which
the author claims that the Pillow library is thread-safe. However, empirical evidence suggests otherwise.

Specifically, the `ImageFile.load` method is not thread-safe because it:
1. Closes and deletes an open file handler
2. Modifies properties of the ImageFile object (namely the `im` property which contains the underlying image data)

Inside Weave, we use threads to parallelize work which may involve Images. This thread-safety issue has manifested
not only in our persistence layer but also in user code where loaded images are accessed across threads.

We call `apply_threadsafe_patch_to_pil_image` in the `__init__.py` file to ensure thread-safety for the ImageFile class.
