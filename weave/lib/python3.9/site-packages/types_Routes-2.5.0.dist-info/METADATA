## Typing stubs for Routes

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Routes` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Routes`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Routes. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `b50ebafa7913cf572ed1d4a87926b49f34fd2dc0`.
