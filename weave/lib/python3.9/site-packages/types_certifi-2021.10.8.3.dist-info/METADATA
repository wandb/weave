## Typing stubs for certifi

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `certifi` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `certifi`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/certifi. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `certifi` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2022.5.18.1. Please uninstall the `types-certifi`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `95128e61ec82c2ca8ec32d6c03bd9dad9ab68e65`.
