## Typing stubs for annoy

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `annoy` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`annoy`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/annoy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `annoy` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.17.1. Please uninstall the `types-annoy`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `201940cdc12e61e3bf5bc3ee4c5fd71bcc23fdf9` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.316, and
pytype 2023.6.16.
