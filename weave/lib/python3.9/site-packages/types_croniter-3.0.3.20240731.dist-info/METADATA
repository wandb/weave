## Typing stubs for croniter

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`croniter`](https://github.com/kiorky/croniter) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`croniter`.

This version of `types-croniter` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `croniter==3.0.3`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/croniter. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.

[`fa70187245751c6fd4d057534af7f9ae3e74a25f`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/fa70187245751c6fd4d057534af7f9ae3e74a25f) and was tested
with mypy 1.10.1, pyright 1.1.373, and
