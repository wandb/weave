## Typing stubs for freezegun

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `freezegun` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `freezegun`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/freezegun. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `freezegun` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 1.2.1. Please uninstall the `types-freezegun`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `81fd55a885e678559471710f249c7e27d02ec212`.
