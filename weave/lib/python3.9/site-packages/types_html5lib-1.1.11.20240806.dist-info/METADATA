## Typing stubs for html5lib

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`html5lib`](https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`html5lib`.

This version of `types-html5lib` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `html5lib==1.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/html5lib. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.

with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.374, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
