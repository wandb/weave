## Typing stubs for six

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`six`](https://github.com/benjaminp/six) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`six`.

This version of `types-six` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `six==1.16.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/six. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`4b11151a0c70a09049c69d8fe69351a739472fea`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/4b11151a0c70a09049c69d8fe69351a739472fea) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.383, and
pytype 2024.9.13.
