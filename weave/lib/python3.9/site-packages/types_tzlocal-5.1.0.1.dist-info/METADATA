## Typing stubs for tzlocal

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`tzlocal`](https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`tzlocal`.

This version of `types-tzlocal` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `tzlocal==5.1`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/tzlocal. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `tzlocal` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 5.2. Please uninstall the `types-tzlocal`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `40caa050ce66a8dd62a62c4b4631767c4092d998` and was tested
with mypy 1.6.1, pyright 1.1.332, and
pytype 2023.10.17.
