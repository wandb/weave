## Typing stubs for pycurl

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pycurl`](https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pycurl`.

This version of `types-pycurl` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pycurl==7.45.3`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pycurl. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `4872c30a98ac9ac649793e9bf3b2682f00cc55d8` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.358, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
