## Typing stubs for atomicwrites

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `atomicwrites` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `atomicwrites`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/atomicwrites. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-atomicwrites` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `03c38d91ae4ea2987f9853539534ce64959abf7a`.
