## Typing stubs for cryptography

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `cryptography` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `cryptography`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/cryptography. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `cryptography` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 3.4.4. Please uninstall the `types-cryptography`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `c0e9038f0d71a38efc672ac5ef11aae0292c0a96`.
