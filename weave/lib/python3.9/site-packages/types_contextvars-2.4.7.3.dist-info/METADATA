## Typing stubs for contextvars

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `contextvars` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`contextvars`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/contextvars. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-contextvars` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `5ad520e27b5e206213dbe209e87c46c483aae7ec` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.316, and
pytype 2023.6.16.
