## Typing stubs for typed-ast

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `typed-ast` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`typed-ast`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/typed-ast. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* `types-typed-ast` is unmaintained and won't be updated.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `597810e46e823732a87dd7c0c6632e2c63a40016` and was tested
with mypy 1.4.1, pyright 1.1.316, and
pytype 2023.6.16.
