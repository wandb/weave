## Typing stubs for aiofiles

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`aiofiles`](https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`aiofiles`.

This version of `types-aiofiles` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `aiofiles==24.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/aiofiles. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `b13bb947c3f7a000d4d4ec6ad2868726a289b2b4` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.369, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
