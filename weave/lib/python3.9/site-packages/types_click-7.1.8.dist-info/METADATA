## Typing stubs for click

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `click` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `click`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/click. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `click` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 8.0. Please uninstall the `types-click`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `2445eddb4b67fdaa58ec7c2113ff1542021a6206`.
