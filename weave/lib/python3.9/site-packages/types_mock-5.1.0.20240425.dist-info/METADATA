## Typing stubs for mock

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`mock`](https://github.com/testing-cabal/mock) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`mock`.

This version of `types-mock` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `mock==5.1.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/mock. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `273e9ea6ddc2d5cad2db7dd25a0383a61be15675` and was tested
with mypy 1.10.0, pyright 1.1.360, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
