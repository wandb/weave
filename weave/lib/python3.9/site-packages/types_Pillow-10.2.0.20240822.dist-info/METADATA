## Typing stubs for Pillow

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`Pillow`](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`Pillow`.

This version of `types-Pillow` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `Pillow==10.2.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/Pillow. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `Pillow` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 10.3.0. Please uninstall the `types-Pillow`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
