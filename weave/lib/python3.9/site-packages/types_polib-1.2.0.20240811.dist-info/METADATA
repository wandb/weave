## Typing stubs for polib

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`polib`](https://github.com/izimobil/polib) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`polib`.

This version of `types-polib` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `polib==1.2.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/polib. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`b406ba9315f9df8e8632df8f9a7ef477b8a60073`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/b406ba9315f9df8e8632df8f9a7ef477b8a60073) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.1, pyright 1.1.375, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
