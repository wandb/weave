## Typing stubs for paramiko

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`paramiko`](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`paramiko`.

This version of `types-paramiko` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `paramiko==3.5.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/paramiko. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
