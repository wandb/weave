    # In summary, there is an outstanding design decision to be made about how to handle the
    # `name` parameter. One school of thought is that using the `name` parameter allows multiple
    # object to use the same artifact more cleanly. However, another school of thought is that
    # the payload should not be dependent on an external name - resulting in different payloads
    # for the same logical object.
    #
    # Using `image.png` is fine for now since we don't have any cases of multiple objects
    # using the same artifact. Moreover, since we package the deserialization logic with the
    # object payload, we can always change the serialization logic later without breaking
    # existing payloads.
