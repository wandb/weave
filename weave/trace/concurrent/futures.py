"""ThreadPoolExecutor for executing tasks in parallel.

This module provides a FutureExecutor class for asynchronous task execution in Weave.
It offers a simple interface for deferring tasks and chaining operations on futures,
which is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations or long-running tasks that
shouldn't block the main execution thread.

The FutureExecutor class includes two main methods:
1. defer: For submitting tasks to be executed asynchronously.
2. then: For chaining operations on futures, allowing for easy composition
   of asynchronous workflows.

These utilities are designed to work seamlessly with Weave's tracing and
context management systems, ensuring that asynchronous operations maintain
the necessary context and can be properly traced and monitored.

Usage of this module can significantly improve the performance and
responsiveness of Weave applications by allowing concurrent execution
of independent tasks, especially in scenarios involving network requests,
file I/O, or other operations with significant waiting times.

To use this module, create an instance of FutureExecutor and use its methods
to manage asynchronous tasks:

    executor = FutureExecutor()
    future = executor.defer(some_function, arg1, arg2)
    result_future = executor.then([future], process_result)
