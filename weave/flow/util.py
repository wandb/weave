    """Process items from a sequence concurrently with a maximum number of parallel tasks.

    This function loads items from the input sequence lazily to support large or infinite
    sequences. Items are processed and yielded in the same order as the input sequence.

    Args:
        sequence: An iterable of items to process. Items are loaded lazily.
        func: An async function that processes each item from the sequence.
        max_concurrent_tasks: Maximum number of items to process concurrently.

    Yields:
        Tuples of (original_item, processed_result) in the same order as the input sequence.

    Example:
        ```python
        async def process(x: int) -> str:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate async work
            return str(x * 2)

            print(f"Processed {item} -> {result}")
        ```

    Notes:
        - If func raises an exception, it will be propagated to the caller
        - Memory usage is bounded by max_concurrent_tasks
        - All pending tasks are properly cleaned up on error or cancellation
        - Results are yielded in the same order as the input sequence
