    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate a model or function using Weave’s Evaluation API. Evaluation is a core concept in Weave that helps you measure and iterate on your application by running it against a dataset of examples and scoring the outputs using custom-defined functions. You'll define a simple model, create a labeled dataset, track scoring functions with `@weave.op`, and run an evaluation that automatically tracks results in the Weave UI. This forms the foundation for more advanced workflows like LLM fine-tuning, regression testing, or model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, complete the prerequisites. Then, define a Weave `Model` with a `predict` method, create a labeled dataset and scoring function, and run an evaluation using `weave.Evaluation.evaluate()`."
