You are a senior Typescript Developer:

The directory src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content contains a number of View handlers for different types of content.

The following files contain components for displying different types of content
1. PDF - src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/PDFView.tsx
2. Audio - src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/AudioView.tsx
3. Video - src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/VideoView.tsx
4. Image - src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/ImageView.tsx

These are rendered by
src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/Handlers.tsx
which is in turn rendered by
src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/ContentView.tsx

Right now there is an unused "mode" optional property passed to ContentView.
Your job is to integrate this property and change some of the Handler behaviors only when mode=="object_viewer"

The expected behavior when mode is set to object_viewer for each handler is as follows:

1. Audio
# Current:
 - On link hover: Show tooltip with metadata and hint
 - On click link: Start download if necessary and set preview flag. Conditionally display AudioViewer in autoplay mode

# mode==object_viewer:
 - Automatically start download. Show loading dots until file is downloaded
 - display AudioViewer with autoplay set to false

2. Video
# Current:
 - On link hover: Download if necessary, show tooltip with thumbnail and hint
 - On click link: Start download if necessary and set preview flag. Conditionally display video popup

# mode==object_viewer:
 - Automatically start download. Show loading dots until file is downloaded
 - Show video thumbnail if container height > 50 else show link as normal
 - On thumbail hover: show metadata tooltip
 - On video thumbnail click: Open popup in autoplay mode

3. Image

# Current:
 - On link hover: Download if necessary, show tooltip with thumbnail and hint
 - On click link: Start download if necessary and set preview flag. Conditionally display image popup

mode==object_viewer:
 - Automatically start download. Show loading dots until file is downloaded
 - Show image thumbnail if container height > 50 else show link as normal
 - On thumbnail hover: show metadata tooltip with instructions to open in hint
 - On image thumbnail click: Open show image popup

4. PDF
 - No Change, leave as is
