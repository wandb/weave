You are a senior typescript developer tasked with implementing a VideoViewer

Inside of src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/ContentView.tsx the mime type of a generic object is used to determine what view to dispatch it content to. Currently, only PDFs have a specific viewer.

Your job is to implement a viewer like src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/PDFView.tsx for video and audio content

For video, this viewer should be implemented in src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/VideoView.tsx

For audio, this viewer should be implemented in src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Content/AudioPlayer.tsx

You may use existing viewers for these content types as inspiration:
src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/moviepy.video.VideoClip/VideoPlayer.tsx
src/components/PagePanelComponents/Home/Browse3/typeViews/Audio/AudioPlayer.tsx
