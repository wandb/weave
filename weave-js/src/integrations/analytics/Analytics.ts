 * Previously `window.analytics.track` was assigned as a default for `track` arguments in function declarations so that the dependency on Segment could be easily injected (useful for things like testing), e.g.:
 * `const makeTracker = (track = window?.analytics?.track) => (name, data) => track(name,data)`
 *
 * However, the fn often runs with the initialization of the JS bundle, which is _before_ the deferred loading of Segment completes and overwrites the fn at `window.analytics.track`. So moving this to an easily mockable exported object. Thus we can easily overwrite it w/ mocks in tests, but the `track` call will still resolve its reference to Segment after initialiation

What we really want is `Record<string, SerializableValue>` but that's not a built-in thing and it's overkill. `unknown` works fine because we don't use these types anywhere downstreamâ€” we just send them off into the Segment void
