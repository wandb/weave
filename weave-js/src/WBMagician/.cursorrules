# Magician Project Cursor Rules

## Living Documentation

The README.md in this directory serves as the single source of truth for the Magician project. It is a living document that must be kept up to date throughout development.

### Update README.md whenever you:

1. **Make Architecture Changes**
   - Add or modify classes, interfaces, or major components
   - Change the data flow or component hierarchy
   - Introduce new dependencies or services

2. **Make Design Decisions**
   - Choose between implementation alternatives
   - Add rationale for technical choices
   - Document trade-offs and constraints

3. **Update Implementation Status**
   - Check off completed tasks in the Implementation Plan
   - Add new tasks discovered during development
   - Update phase timelines if needed

4. **Add Code Examples**
   - Include new usage patterns discovered during implementation
   - Update existing examples if APIs change
   - Add edge cases or gotchas

5. **Document Issues & Solutions**
   - Record blocking issues and their resolutions
   - Note workarounds for technical limitations
   - Track deferred decisions for post-hackweek

### How to Update

- Make inline updates to relevant sections
- Add a "Recent Updates" section at the top if making major changes
- Keep the document scannable - use clear headings and bullet points
- Preserve the overall structure unless a major refactor is needed

### Collaboration Notes

- This README is our shared context between conversations
- Always read the current state before making changes
- If the conversation history is lost, the README should contain enough context to continue
- Include TODOs inline with clear ownership (e.g., "TODO: Implement streaming - blocked on API key setup")

### Code and Documentation Sync

- Type definitions in README should match actual implementation
- If you change an API, update both code and README in the same commit
- Examples in README should be runnable (test them!)

Remember: The README is not just documentation - it's our project memory and collaboration tool.
