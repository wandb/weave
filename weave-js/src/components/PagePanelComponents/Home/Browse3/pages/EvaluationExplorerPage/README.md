# EvaluationExplorerPage

The EvaluationExplorerPage provides an interactive interface for building and running evaluations on Weave models. Users can configure datasets, models, and scorers, then run evaluations to assess model performance.

## Directory Structure

### Core Files
- **`EvaluationExplorerPage.tsx`**: Main component that orchestrates the evaluation explorer UI with validation and evaluation running
- **`context.tsx`**: React context for managing evaluation configuration state
- **`types.ts`**: TypeScript type definitions for evaluation configuration structures
- **`state.ts`**: State initialization and management utilities
- **`constants.ts`**: Shared constants (colors, styling)

### Configuration Sections
- **`DatasetConfigSection.tsx`**: UI for selecting and configuring datasets
  - Supports creating new datasets (from scratch or file upload)
  - Integrates with VersionedObjectPicker for dataset selection
- **`ModelsConfigSection.tsx`**: UI for managing models to evaluate
  - Allows adding multiple models with version selection
  - Uses ModelRow component for optimized rendering
- **`ScorersConfigSection.tsx`**: UI for configuring evaluation scorers
  - Supports LLM-as-a-Judge scorers
  - Uses ScorerRow component for optimized rendering
- **`EvaluationConfigSection.tsx`**: Evaluation picker for loading previous evaluations

### Supporting Components
- **`DatasetEditor.tsx`**: Components for creating and editing datasets
  - `NewDatasetEditor`: Create datasets from scratch or upload files
  - `ExistingDatasetEditor`: View and edit existing datasets
- **`VersionedObjectPicker.tsx`**: Unified component for selecting versioned objects
  - Two-level selection: object â†’ version
  - Shows version labels (latest, v1, v2) with commit hashes
  - Supports "new" options for creating new objects
- **`layout.tsx`**: Reusable layout components
  - `ConfigSection`: Section wrapper with validation support
  - `Column`, `Row`, `Header`, `Footer`: Layout primitives
- **`components.tsx`**: Shared UI components
  - `LabeledTextField`: Text input with label, validation, and instructions
  - `LabeledTextArea`: Text area with same features
  - `LoadingSelect`: Select component in loading state

### Shared Components (from MonitorsPage)
- **`ModelConfigurationForm.tsx`**: Reusable form for configuring LLM models
  - Used by both LLMAsAJudgeScorerForm and ModelsConfigSection
  - Handles model selection, configuration, and saving
  - Provides validation and state management

### Utilities
- **`common.ts`**: Common utility functions (e.g., `refStringToName`)
- **`hooks.tsx`**: Custom React hooks for data fetching and state management
- **`query.ts`**: Data query functions for interacting with Weave API
  - `getLatestDatasetRefs`: Fetches available dataset references
  - `getLatestModelRefs`: Fetches available model references
  - `getLatestScorerRefs`: Fetches available scorer references
  - `getLatestEvaluationRefs`: Fetches available evaluation references
  - `getObjByRef`: Loads a specific object by its reference
  - `createEvaluation`: Creates new evaluation in Weave
  - `runEvaluation`: Executes evaluation against models

## Architecture

The page follows a modular architecture:

1. **State Management**: Uses React Context with Immer for immutable state updates
2. **Configuration Structure**: 
   - Evaluation definition (name, description, dataset, scorers)
   - Models array separate from evaluation (model-agnostic evaluations)
   - Lazy references with version tracking
3. **Validation System**:
   - Field-level validation (shows errors after blur)
   - Section-level validation (always visible)
   - Required field indicators
   - Comprehensive error/warning/info messaging
4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Memoized callbacks for object pickers
   - Separate row components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Lazy loading with Weave refs

## Key Features

### Form Validation
The UI provides comprehensive validation feedback:
- **Required Fields**: Name and description with asterisk indicators
- **Touch State**: Errors only show after field interaction
- **Section Errors**: Guide users on what needs configuration
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Red errors, yellow warnings, gray info

### Version-Aware Object Selection
The `VersionedObjectPicker` provides sophisticated object selection:
- Two dropdowns: object selector (60%) and version selector (40%)
- Auto-selects latest version when object is chosen
- Shows meaningful version labels with commit info
- Supports multiple "new" options for flexibility

### Evaluation Running
Complete workflow for running evaluations:
1. Validates all required fields are filled
2. Creates evaluation object in Weave
3. Runs evaluation against selected models
4. Shows loading state during execution
5. Displays results using CompareEvaluationsPageContent

### Evaluation Loading
Users can load previous evaluations:
- Toggle button in header to show/hide picker
- Loads all evaluation properties including datasets and scorers
- Clears state when creating new evaluation
- Shows selected evaluation name when picker is hidden

## UI Flow

1. **Configuration Phase**:
   - Fill in evaluation name and description
   - Select or create a dataset
   - Add one or more scorers
   - Add one or more models to evaluate

2. **Validation**:
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - "Run eval" button disabled until all requirements met
   - Clear error messages guide user actions

3. **Execution**:
   - Click "Run eval" to start
   - Loading state shows progress
   - Results automatically display when complete

4. **Results**:
   - Shows evaluation results in main panel
   - Configuration panel remains visible
   - "Back to Dataset" button returns to configuration

## Development Notes

- Uses Wandb's component library for consistent styling
- Tailwind CSS for drawer components
- React hooks follow naming convention: `use[Feature]`
- Query functions wrapped with `clientBound(hookify())` pattern
- All callbacks passed to child components are properly memoized
- Follows TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type safety
