# magician Project Cursor Rules


## Living Documentation

The requirements.md in this directory serves as the single source of truth for the magician project. It is a living document that must be kept up to date throughout development.

### Update requirements.md whenever you:

1. **Add New Components or Hooks**
   - Create new magic components (MagicFill, MagicChat, MagicTool/Act)
   - Add new React hooks for LLM integration
   - Modify the chatCompletionClient interface
   - Change component props or behavior

2. **Make Design Decisions**
   - Choose between UI/UX implementation alternatives
   - Select model providers or default configurations
   - Document why simplicity was chosen over features
   - Record lessons learned from WBMagician v1

3. **Update Implementation Status**
   - Check off completed tasks in the Remaining Tasks section
   - Move tasks between priority levels (P0, P1, P2, P3)
   - Add new tasks discovered during development
   - Update integration points as they're implemented

4. **Add Integration Examples**
   - Document how MagicFill is used in specific forms
   - Show playground prompt helper implementation
   - Add patterns for different response formats
   - Include developer-facing configuration examples

5. **Document API Changes**
   - Update chatCompletionClient capabilities
   - Note changes to response format handling
   - Track provider-specific implementations
   - Document breaking changes from v1

### How to Update

- Make inline updates to relevant sections
- Keep task lists current - mark completed items with [x]
- Add date stamps to completed P0 tasks
- Preserve the "Out of Scope" section to prevent feature creep
- Update component status: (Current Implementation), (In Progress), (Planned), (Future)

### Simplicity Guidelines

- **Always ask**: Does this make the module simpler or more complex?
- If adding complexity, document why it's necessary
- Reference WBMagician v1 mistakes to avoid
- Keep the API surface minimal
- Prefer composition over configuration

### Code and Documentation Sync

- Component props in code must match documentation
- Response format types should align with chatCompletionClient.tsx
- Example configurations should be tested and working
- System prompts in examples should be realistic

### Testing Magic Components

When implementing or modifying magic components:
- Test with real LLM calls (not mocks) during development
- Document edge cases (empty responses, errors, timeouts)
- Include fallback behavior in both code and docs
- Note any provider-specific quirks

### Collaboration Notes

- This project prioritizes developer experience over features
- The first user is always another frontend engineer
- If unsure about complexity, choose the simpler path
- Document "why not" decisions as much as "why" decisions

Remember: magician exists because v1 became too complex. Every decision should be made with simplicity in mind.
