      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return

      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!

      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +
      \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan
      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +
      \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan
      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +
      \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan
      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +
      \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan
      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +
      \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan
      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:

      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979

      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:

      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,

      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems

      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the

      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope

      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age

      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",
      \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page
      = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 +

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems

      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I

      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the

      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems

      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age

      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!

      an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given
      a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a
      list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call
      with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of ''Thought:'', ''Code:'', and ''Observation:'' sequences.\n\nAt
      each step, in the ''Thought:'' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the ''Code:''
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with ''<end_code>'' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      ''print()'' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the ''Observation:'' field, which will be
      available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final
      answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional
      tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:
      \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living
      in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest
      person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old
      man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What
      is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I
      will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3
      + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the
      question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.
      The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments,
      that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{''question'':
      ''Quel est l''animal sur l''image?'', ''image'': ''path/to/image.jpg''}\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the
      consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought:
      I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages
      = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo
      result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find
      any results. Let''s try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979
      interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound
      6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam
      discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\",

      Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician.
      He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the
      hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought:
      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems
      to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let''s answer
      in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city
      in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city}
      population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: [''Guangzhou
      has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'']\nPopulation Shanghai:
      ''26 million (2019)''\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:
      \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope
      age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current
      pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope
      age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that
      the pope is 88 years old. Let''s compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\n    \"\"\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based on your
      query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\n\n    Args:\n        query:
      The search query to perform.\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef final_answer(answer: any) ->
      any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer:
      The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you
      should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a ''Thought:'' sequence,
      and a ''Code:\\n```py'' sequence ending with ''```<end_code>'' sequence, else
      you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use
      the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in
      ''answer = wiki({''query'': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})'',
      but use the arguments directly as in ''answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place
      where James Bond lives?\")''.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential
      tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only
      when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact
      same parameters.\n6. Don''t name any new variable with the same name as a tool:
      for instance don''t name a variable ''final_answer''.\n7. Never create any notional
      variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the
      true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following
      list of modules: [''collections'', ''datetime'', ''itertools'', ''math'', ''queue'',
      ''random'', ''re'', ''stat'', ''statistics'', ''time'', ''unicodedata'']\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you''ve created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don''t give up!
      You''re in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow

      how to do it in an unrestricted environment.\n\n1. **Environment**: Make sure
      you have Python installed along with `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries.
      You can install them using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n2.
      **Code**: Use the following code in your local environment to fetch and print
      the webpage title:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n   def
      get_page_title(url):\n       response = requests.get(url)\n       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content,
      ''html.parser'')\n       return soup.title.string\n\n   title = get_page_title(\"https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/\")\n   print(\"The
      title of the page is:\", title)\n   ```\n\nThis will fetch and display the title
      of the webpage when executed in a suitable environment. Thank you for your understanding
      and patience with the limitations here.\n            Make sure to include code
      with the correct pattern, for instance:\n            Thoughts: Your thoughts\n            Code:\n            ```py\n            #
      Your python code here\n            ```<end_code>\nMake sure to provide correct
      code blobs.\nNow let''s retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you
      have retried several times, try a completely different approach.\n"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Thought:

      given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access
      to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can
      call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\\n\\nAt
      each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the 'Code:'
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with '<end_code>' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available
      as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using
      the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:
      \\\"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack
      living in Newfoundland.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing
      the oldest person.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nimage = image_generator(\\\"A portrait
      of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\nCode:\\n```py\\nresult = 5
      + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\\\"Answer
      the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable
      `image`. The question is in French.\\nYou have been provided with these additional
      arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\\n{'question':
      'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\\\"\\n\\nThought:

      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\\nWhat does he say was
      the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one
      word?\\n\\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus

      find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npages

      answer in one word.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfor city
      in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n    print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\",
      search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nPopulation
      Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\\nPopulation
      Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\\n\\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the
      highest population.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\\\"current pope
      age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search
      = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google
      search:\\\", pope_age_search)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nPope age: \\\"The
      pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I know that the pope
      is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based
      on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\\n\\n
      \   Args:\\n        query: The search query to perform.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef
      final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Provides a final answer
      to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the
      problem\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always
      follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a
      'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will
      fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right
      arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer =
      wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use
      the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where
      James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool
      calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool
      only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the
      exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as
      a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create
      any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail
      you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only
      from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools',
      'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!
      You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow
      Begin!\"}]},{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"New

      of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\\n\\nAt
      each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning

      Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\\n\\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the
      highest population.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\\\"current pope
      age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search
      = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google
      search:\\\", pope_age_search)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nPope age: \\\"The
      pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I know that the pope
      is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based
      on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\\n\\n
      \   Args:\\n        query: The search query to perform.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef
      final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Provides a final answer
      to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the
      problem\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always
      follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a
      'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will
      fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right
      arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer =
      wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use
      the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where
      James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool
      calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool
      only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the
      exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as
      a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create
      any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail
      you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only
      from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools',
      'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!
      You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow

      are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be
      given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access
      to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can
      call with code.\\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series
      of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\\n\\nAt
      each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning
      towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\\nThen in the 'Code:'
      sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must
      end with '<end_code>' sequence.\\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use
      'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\\nThese
      print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available
      as input for the next step.\\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using
      the `final_answer` tool.\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find
      the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image
      according to the answer.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nanswer = document_qa(document=document,
      question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:
      \\\"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack
      living in Newfoundland.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing
      the oldest person.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nimage = image_generator(\\\"A portrait
      of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return
      the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\\nCode:\\n```py\\nresult = 5
      + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\n\\\"Answer
      the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable
      `image`. The question is in French.\\nYou have been provided with these additional
      arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\\n{'question':
      'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into
      English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\\nCode:\\n```py\\ntranslated_question
      = translator(question=question, src_lang=\\\"French\\\", tgt_lang=\\\"English\\\")\\nprint(f\\\"The
      translated question is {translated_question}.\\\")\\nanswer = image_qa(image=image,
      question=translated_question)\\nfinal_answer(f\\\"The answer is {answer}\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:\\nIn
      a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other
      great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\\nWhat does he say was
      the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one
      word?\\n\\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus
      Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npages = search(query=\\\"1979 interview

      result found for query \\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists
      Einstein\\\".\\n\\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not
      find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npages
      = search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nFound

      I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says
      of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it
      seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's
      answer in one word.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the
      tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfor city
      in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n    print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\",
      search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nPopulation
      Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\\nPopulation
      Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\\n\\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the
      highest population.\\nCode:\\n```py\\nfinal_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\\n```<end_code>\\n\\n---\\nTask:
      \\\"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\\\"\\n\\nThought:
      I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with
      a web search.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\\\"current pope
      age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search
      = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google
      search:\\\", pope_age_search)\\n```<end_code>\\nObservation:\\nPope age: \\\"The
      pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\\\"\\n\\nThought: I know that the pope
      is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\\nCode:\\n```py\\npope_current_age
      = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\\n```<end_code>\\n\\nAbove example
      were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing
      computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access
      to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\\n```python\\ndef web_search(query:
      string) -> string:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Performs a duckduckgo web search based
      on your query (think a Google search) then returns the top search results.\\n\\n
      \   Args:\\n        query: The search query to perform.\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\ndef
      final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Provides a final answer
      to the given problem.\\n\\n    Args:\\n        answer: The final answer to the
      problem\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always
      follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a
      'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will
      fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right
      arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer =
      wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use
      the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where
      James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool
      calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable.
      For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not
      have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather
      output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool
      only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the
      exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as
      a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create
      any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail
      you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only
      from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools',
      'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\\n9.
      The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created
      variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!
      You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\\n\\nNow
