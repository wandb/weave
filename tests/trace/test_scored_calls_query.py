    This is a unified test for both scorer and op tests. It ensures that we can query for calls
    that have been scored by any type of scorer and ensures that we correctly differentiate between
    versions of the same scorer.

    We also ensure that the low-level and high-level queries return the same results. This is because
    we will likely implement a better query at the service layer and we want to ensure that the high
    level api continues to work correctly. We don't really want users to manually write the mongo
    query, so that part of these tests is just here for correctness.

    The only user-facing api we really want to maintain is the param `scored_by` on the client.
