# # ðŸš€ Prompt Engineering Workshop with Weave
# 
# Welcome to this hands-on workshop where we'll explore prompt engineering techniques while learning how Weave can help us build better LLM applications!
# 
# ## What we'll cover:
# 1. **Basic Prompt Engineering** - Extracting structured data from unstructured text
# 2. **Prompt Iteration** - Using Weave to track and compare different prompts
# 3. **Few-shot Learning** - Improving results with examples
# 4. **Evaluation** - Building datasets and scoring functions
# 5. **Advanced Techniques** - Chain of thought, role playing, and more
# 
# ## Our Use Case: Customer Support Triage ðŸ“§
# We'll build a system that extracts key information from customer support emails to help route them efficiently.

# ## Workshop Exercises ðŸŽ¯
# 
# Now it's your turn! Try these exercises to practice prompt engineering:
# 
# ### Exercise 1: Handle Edge Cases
# Create a new version that handles emails where:
# - The customer name is not explicitly stated
# - Multiple products are mentioned
# - The issue is vague or unclear
# 
# ### Exercise 2: Add New Fields
# Extend the extraction to include:
# - Urgency level (low/medium/high)
# - Customer sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
# - Category (hardware/software/other)
# 
# ### Exercise 3: Multi-language Support
# Create a version that can handle emails in different languages
# 
# ### Exercise 4: Custom Evaluation Metrics
# Design your own scoring function that better reflects real-world requirements

# %%

# ## Key Takeaways ðŸŽ“
# 
# 1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts and iterate
# 2. **Be Specific**: Clear instructions improve results
# 3. **Use Examples**: Few-shot learning can significantly improve accuracy
# 4. **Test Systematically**: Use evaluation datasets to measure improvements
# 5. **Track Everything**: Weave helps you understand what works and why
# 
# ## Weave Features Showcased:
# - **@weave.op**: Track function calls and compare versions
# - **weave.Dataset**: Organize evaluation data
# - **Automatic Logging**: See inputs, outputs, and errors
# - **Version Comparison**: Understand which prompts work best
# - **Performance Tracking**: Monitor latency and costs
# 
# ## Next Steps:
# 1. Explore the Weave dashboard to see all your tracked experiments
# 2. Try different models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
# 3. Build more complex chains and workflows
# 4. Create production-ready evaluations
# 
# Happy prompting! ðŸš€
