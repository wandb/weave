    "Weave is a toolkit for developing AI-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Weave to:\n",
    "- Log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces.\n",
    "- Build rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations for language model use cases.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate a model or function using Weave’s Evaluation API. Evaluation is a core concept in Weave that helps you measure and iterate on your application by running it against a dataset of examples and scoring the outputs using custom-defined functions. You'll define a simple model, create a labeled dataset, track scoring functions with `@weave.op`, and run an evaluation that automatically tracks results in the Weave UI. This forms the foundation for more advanced workflows like LLM fine-tuning, regression testing, or model comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, complete the prerequisites. Then, define a Weave `Model` with a `predict` method, create a labeled dataset and scoring function, and run an evaluation using `weave.Evaluation.evaluate()`."

    "The following code sample shows how to evaluate an LLM using Weave’s `Model` and `Evaluation` APIs. First, define a Weave model by subclassing `weave.Model`, specifying the model name and prompt format, and tracking a `predict` method with `@weave.op`. The `predict` method sends a prompt to OpenAI and parses the response into a structured output using a Pydantic schema (`FruitExtract`). Then, create a small evaluation dataset consisting of input sentences and expected targets. Next, define a custom scoring function (also tracked using `@weave.op`) that compares the model’s output to the target label. Finally,  wrap everything in a `weave.Evaluation`, specifying your dataset and scorers, and call `evaluate()` to run the evaluation pipeline asynchronously."
