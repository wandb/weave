    "# Custom Routing for LLM Prompts with Not Diamond\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Weave with [Not Diamond's custom routing](https://docs.notdiamond.ai/docs/router-training-quickstart) to route LLM prompts to the most appropriate model based on evaluation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Routing prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "When building complex LLM workflows users may need to prompt different models according to accuracy, cost, or call latency.\n",
    "Users can use [Not Diamond](https://www.notdiamond.ai/) to route prompts in these workflows to the right model for their needs, helping maximize accuracy while saving on model costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any given distribution of data, rarely will one single model outperform every other model on every single query. By combining together multiple models into a \"meta-model\" that learns when to call each LLM, you can beat every individual model's performance and even drive down costs and latency in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Custom routing\n",
    "\n",
    "You need three things to train a custom router for your prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set of LLM prompts: Prompts must be strings and should be representative of the prompts used in our application.\n",
    "1. LLM responses: The responses from candidate LLMs for each input. Candidate LLMs can include both our supported LLMs and your own custom models.\n",
    "1. Evaluation scores for responses to the inputs from candidate LLMs: Scores are numbers, and can be any metric that fit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By submitting these to the Not Diamond API you can then train a custom router tuned to each of your workflows.\n"
