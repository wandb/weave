# # üêù Weave Workshop: Build, Track, and Evaluate LLM Applications
#
# <img src="http://wandb.me/logo-im-png" width="400" alt="Weights & Biases" />
#
# Welcome to the Weave workshop! In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to use Weave to develop, debug, and evaluate AI-powered applications.
#
# **What you'll learn:**
# - üîç **Trace & Debug**: Track every LLM call, see inputs/outputs, and debug issues
# - üìä **Evaluate**: Build rigorous evaluations with multiple scoring functions
# - üèÉ **Compare**: Run A/B tests and compare different approaches
# - üìà **Monitor**: Track costs, latency, and performance metrics
# - üéØ **Iterate**: Use data-driven insights to improve your application

# ## üîë Prerequisites

# Before we begin, let's set up your environment.

# Install dependencies

# ## üìä Part 2: Building Evaluations
#
# Now let's evaluate our email analyzer using Weave's evaluation framework.
# We'll use a more challenging dataset to expose model weaknesses.

# **Understanding Weave's Evaluation Data Model:**
# 1. An **evaluation** is the pairing of a dataset and a set of scorers (think of it like a test suite for a specific task)
# 2. An **evaluation run** is the result of running an evaluation against a specific model
# 3. Within an evaluation run, there are (num_rows * num_trials) **predict_and_score** blocks which contain the prediction calls and the scoring calls for a single row of the dataset
# 4. Scores are stored within the predict_and_score output, but also directly on the prediction call itself


# %%
# Define our data structure
class CustomerEmail(BaseModel):
    customer_name: str
    product: str
    issue: str
    sentiment: str = Field(description="positive, neutral, or negative")

# ### üìù Part 2.3: Using EvaluationLogger
#
# The `EvaluationLogger` provides a flexible way to log evaluation data incrementally.
# This is perfect when you don't have all your data upfront or want more control.
#
# **Important**: Since EvaluationLogger doesn't use Model/Dataset objects, the `model`
# and `dataset` parameters are crucial for identification.
# - `model`: Can be a string OR dictionary (for rich metadata)
# - `dataset`: Must be a string

# %%
# Example using EvaluationLogger for custom evaluation flow
# You can use simple strings for identification (commented out on purpose)
# eval_logger = EvaluationLogger(
#     model="email_analyzer_gpt35",  # Model name/version
#     dataset="support_emails",  # Dataset name (must be string)
# )

# Model can use dictionaries for richer identification (recommended!)
# Dataset must be a string
eval_logger_rich = EvaluationLogger(
    model={
        "name": "email_analyzer",
        "version": "v1.2",

        "prompt_version": "2024-01",
    },
    dataset="support_emails_2024Q1",  # Dataset must be string
)

   - Include full name if available (e.g., "Dr. Rajesh Patel" not just "Raj")
   
2. Product: Identify the SPECIFIC product having issues
   - If multiple products mentioned, focus on the problematic one
   - Include version numbers if provided
   - Don't confuse product names with people names
   
3. Sentiment: Analyze the OVERALL tone
   - positive: satisfied, happy, thankful (even with minor complaints)
   - negative: frustrated, angry, disappointed
   - neutral: matter-of-fact, indifferent, mixed feelings
   - Consider sarcasm and actual meaning beyond words""",

# ### üîÑ Part 2.5: A/B Testing Models

# (same dataset + scorers) for all models. This ensures fair comparison and allows
# everyone in the workshop to see aggregated results. Each evaluation run gets a
# unique ID automatically, but the evaluation definition stays consistent.

# TODO: Interactive challenge time. (leaderboard competition)
# Now we are going to see who can creat the best model
# TODO: setup the leaderboard (either interactively in the UI, or add a cell below)
# Invite students to iterate on the prompt / model to get higher performance (which we will track in the leaderboard!)
