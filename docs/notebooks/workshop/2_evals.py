# ## üìä Part 2: Building Evaluations
#
# Now let's evaluate our email analyzer using Weave's evaluation framework.
# We'll use a more challenging dataset to expose model weaknesses.

# **Understanding Weave's Evaluation Data Model:**
# 1. An **evaluation** is the pairing of a dataset and a set of scorers (think of it like a test suite for a specific task)
# 2. An **evaluation run** is the result of running an evaluation against a specific model
# 3. Within an evaluation run, there are (num_rows * num_trials) **predict_and_score** blocks which contain the prediction calls and the scoring calls for a single row of the dataset
# 4. Scores are stored within the predict_and_score output, but also directly on the prediction call itself


# %%
# Define our data structure

# ### üéØ Part 2.1: Using Pre-built Scorers
#
# Weave provides many pre-built scorers for common evaluation tasks!
# No need to reinvent the wheel for standard metrics.
#
# **Note**: To use pre-built scorers, install with: `pip install weave[scorers]`

# %%
# Import pre-built scorers
from weave.scorers import (
    EmbeddingSimilarityScorer,
    OpenAIModerationScorer,
    PydanticScorer,
    ValidJSONScorer,
)

# Example 1: ValidJSONScorer - Check if output is valid JSON
json_scorer = ValidJSONScorer()

print("üéØ Example 1: ValidJSONScorer")
# Test with valid JSON
valid_json = '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "email": "john@example.com"}'

# Test with invalid JSON

)
invalid_result = asyncio.run(json_scorer.score(output=invalid_json))

# Test with valid data

# Example 3: EmbeddingSimilarityScorer - Semantic similarity
# Use EmbeddingSimilarityScorer (requires OpenAI API key)

# Example 4: OpenAIModerationScorer - Content safety
# Use OpenAIModerationScorer

# Test content moderation on potentially problematic text

# ### üìù Part 2.3: Using EvaluationLogger
#
# The `EvaluationLogger` provides a flexible way to log evaluation data incrementally.
# This is perfect when you don't have all your data upfront or want more control.
#
# **Important**: Since EvaluationLogger doesn't use Model/Dataset objects, the `model`
# and `dataset` parameters are crucial for identification.
# - `model`: Can be a string OR dictionary (for rich metadata)
# - `dataset`: Must be a string

# %%
# Example using EvaluationLogger for custom evaluation flow
# You can use simple strings for identification (commented out on purpose)
# eval_logger = EvaluationLogger(
#     model="email_analyzer_gpt35",  # Model name/version
#     dataset="support_emails",  # Dataset name (must be string)
# )

# Model can use dictionaries for richer identification (recommended!)
# Dataset must be a string
eval_logger_rich = EvaluationLogger(
    model={
        "name": "email_analyzer",
        "version": "v1.2",
        "llm": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "prompt_version": "2024-01",
    },
    dataset="support_emails_2024Q1",  # Dataset must be string
)

# Let's use the rich logger for our demo
print("üìä Using EvaluationLogger with rich metadata...")

# Process each example with more control
for i, example in enumerate(eval_examples[:3]):  # Just first 3 for demo
    # Analyze the email
    try:
        output = analyze_customer_email(example["email"])

        # Log the prediction
        pred_logger = eval_logger_rich.log_prediction(
            inputs={"email": example["email"]}, output=output.model_dump()

        # Log multiple scores for this prediction
        # Check name accuracy
        name_match = example["expected_name"].lower() == output.customer_name.lower()
        pred_logger.log_score(scorer="name_accuracy", score=1.0 if name_match else 0.0)

        # Check sentiment
        sentiment_match = example["expected_sentiment"] == output.sentiment

# ### üîÑ Part 2.5: A/B Testing Models
#
# **Important Concept**: When comparing models, we use the SAME evaluation definition
# (same dataset + scorers) for all models. This ensures fair comparison and allows
# everyone in the workshop to see aggregated results. Each evaluation run gets a
# unique ID automatically, but the evaluation definition stays consistent.


# %%
# Create a single evaluation definition that will be used for all models
evaluation = Evaluation(
    name="email_analyzer_comparison",  # Same eval for all models
    dataset=support_dataset,
    scorers=[name_accuracy, sentiment_accuracy, extraction_quality],
)

            __weave={"display_name": f"email_analyzer_comparison - {model.label}"},
        )
        results[model.label] = eval_result

# ### üéØ Part 2.6: Leaderboard Competition
#
# Now it's time for a friendly competition! We'll use Weave's leaderboard feature to track
# who can create the best email analysis model. Everyone will use the same evaluation
# (`email_analyzer_comparison`) so results are directly comparable.
#
# **Your challenge**: Improve the prompt/model to get the highest scores on:
# - Name accuracy
# - Sentiment accuracy
# - Overall extraction quality
#
# **Leaderboard Setup**: We can create a leaderboard to track all submissions using the
# same evaluation definition. This ensures fair comparison across all participants.

This leaderboard tracks the best email analysis models from workshop participants.

### Scoring Metrics

1. **Name Accuracy**: Fraction of emails where the customer name was correctly extracted
2. **Sentiment Accuracy**: Fraction of emails where the sentiment was correctly identified  
3. **Extraction Quality**: Overall quality score for extracting all required fields

### Tips for Success
- Focus on clear, specific prompts
- Handle edge cases (names in signatures, multiple products mentioned)
- Consider the context and nuances in sentiment analysis
