    "You've learned how to use Weave's evaluation framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Dataset Creation**: Built challenging evaluation datasets\n",
    "- ✅ **Custom Scorers**: Created scoring functions for specific metrics\n",
    "- ✅ **Pre-built Scorers**: Used Weave's built-in evaluation tools\n",
    "- ✅ **Pairwise Evaluation**: Compared models head-to-head\n",
    "- ✅ **Model Comparison**: Ran systematic A/B tests\n",
    "- ✅ **Leaderboards**: Tracked performance across participants\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Continue to Part 3: Production Monitoring\n",
    "- Experiment with different prompts and models\n",
    "- Try the evaluation framework on your own use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Systematic evaluation reveals model strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "- Challenging datasets expose edge cases and failure modes\n",
    "- Leaderboards encourage continuous improvement and collaboration\n",
    "- Weave makes it easy to compare models and track progress over time"
