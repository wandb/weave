    "# Summarization using Chain of Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing complex technical documents while preserving crucial details is a challenging task. The Chain of Density (CoD) summarization technique offers a solution by iteratively refining summaries to be more concise and information-dense. This guide demonstrates how to implement CoD using Weave, a powerful framework for building, tracking, and evaluating LLM applications. By combining CoD's effectiveness with Weave's robust tooling, you'll learn to create a summarization pipeline that produces high-quality, entity-rich summaries of technical content while gaining insights into the summarization process.\n",

    "1. Starting with an initial summary\n",
    "2. Iteratively refining the summary, making it more concise while preserving key information\n",
    "3. Increasing the density of entities and technical details with each iteration\n",

    "1. **Track your LLM pipeline**: Use Weave to automatically log inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps of your summarization process.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate LLM outputs**: Create rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations of your summaries using Weave's built-in tools.\n",
    "3. **Build composable operations**: Combine and reuse Weave operations across different parts of your summarization pipeline.\n",
    "4. **Integrate seamlessly**: Add Weave to your existing Python code with minimal overhead.\n",
