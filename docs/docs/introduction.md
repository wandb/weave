# Introduction

*üç≤ This version of Weave is pre-release software. üç≤*

Weave is a toolkit for developing AI-powered applications, built by [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai).

Our goal is to bring rigor, best-practices, and composability to the inherently experimental process of developing AI-based software.

The core concept of Weave is its ability to monitor function calls, including their inputs and outputs, as your code executes. This eliminates the need to master a declarative language or understand an intricate object hierarchy. Just decorate functions with `@weave.op` to [get started](/quickstart).


## Key concepts

Weave's **core types** layer contains everything you need to develop AI-powered applications, with built-in lineage, tracking, and reproducibility.

  - **[Datasets](/guides/core-types/datasets)**: Version, store, and share rich tabular data.
  - **[Models](/guides/core-types/models)**: Version, store and share parameterized functions.
  - **[Evaluations](/guides/core-types/evaluations)**: Test suites for AI models.
  - [soon] Agents: ...

Weave's **tracking** layer brings immutable tracing and versioning to your applications and experiments.

  - **[Objects](/guides/tracking/objects)**: Weave's extensible serialization lets you easily version, track, and share Python objects.
  - **[Ops](/guides/tracking/ops)**: Versioned, reproducible functions, with automatic tracing.
  - **[Tracing](/guides/tracking/tracing)**: Automatic organization of function calls and data lineage.

Weave's **ecosystem** is batteries included for other libraries, systems, and best practices.

  - **[OpenAI](/guides/ecosystem/openai)**: automatic tracking for openai api calls
  - [soon] Langchain auto-logging
  - [soon] llama-index auto-logging

Weave's **tools** layer contains utilities for making use of Weave objects.
  
  - **[Serve](/guides/tools/serve)**: FastAPI server for Weave Ops and Models
  - **[Deploy](/guides/tools/deploy)**: Deploy Weave Ops and Models to various targets
