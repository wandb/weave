# Introduction

**Weave** is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications, built by Weights & Biases.

Our goal is to bring rigor, best-practices, and composability to the inherently experimental process of developing AI applications, without introducing cognitive overhead.

**[Get started](/quickstart)** by decorating Python functions with `@weave.op()`.

Seriously, try the 🍪 **[quickstart](/quickstart)** 🍪 or <a class="vertical-align-colab-button" target="\_blank" href="http://wandb.me/weave_colab" onClick={()=>{window.analytics?.track("Weave Docs: Quickstart colab clicked")}}><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

You can use Weave to:

- Log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces
- Build rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations for language model use cases
- Organize all the information generated across the LLM workflow, from experimentation to evaluations to production
