# W&B Weave

Weights & Biases (W&B) Weave is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM-based applications. Designed for flexibility and scalability, Weave supports every stage of your LLM application development workflow:

- **Track:** Log and analyze LLM application inputs and outputs for debugging and further analysis.
- **Experiment:** Test and compare models, prompts, inputs, and outputs.
- **Evaluate:** Track costs, score and annotate model inputs and outputs, and systematically evaluate your application.
- **Deploy:** Implement safety guardrails such as content moderation or access control, and monitor production systems.
- **Iterate:** Systematically refine and enhance your application.

You can interact programmatically with Weave via a [Python SDK](./reference/python-sdk/weave/index.md), [TypeScript SDK](./reference/typescript-sdk/weave/README.md), or the Service API.

Weave [integrates](./guides/integrations/index.md) with numerous popular LLM providers, local models, frameworks, and third-party services.

## Get started

Are you new to Weave? Set up and start using Weave with the [Python quickstart](/quickstart) or [TypeScript quickstart](./reference/generated_typescript_docs/intro-notebook.md).
