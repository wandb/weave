# DSPy

[DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/) is a framework for algorithmically optimizing LM prompts and weights, especially when LMs are used one or more times within a pipeline. Weave automatically tracks and logs calls made using DSPy modules and functions.

## Tracing

It’s important to store traces of language model applications in a central location, both during development and in production. These traces can be useful for debugging, and as a dataset that will help you improve your application.

Weave will automatically capture traces for [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/). To start tracking, calling `weave.init(project_name="<YOUR-WANDB-PROJECT-NAME>")` and use the library as normal.

```python
import os
import dspy
import weave

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>"

weave.init(project_name="<YOUR-WANDB-PROJECT-NAME>")

gpt3_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", max_tokens=300)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt3_turbo)
classify = dspy.Predict("sentence -> sentiment")
classify(sentence="it's a charming and often affecting journey.")
```

## Track your own ops

Wrapping a function with `@weave.op` starts capturing inputs, outputs and app logic so you can debug how data flows through your app. You can deeply nest ops and build a tree of functions that you want to track. This also starts automatically versioning code as you experiment to capture ad-hoc details that haven't been committed to git.

Simply create a function decorated with [`@weave.op`](/guides/tracking/ops).

In the example below, we have the function `validate_context_and_answer` which is the metric function wrapped with `@weave.op`. This helps us see how intermediate steps, like the optimization step for a DSPy application, are affecting the results.

```python
import dspy
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot

import weave


class GenerateAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factoid answers."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="may contain relevant facts")
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")


class RAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_passages=3):
        super().__init__()

        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)
    
    def forward(self, question):
        context = self.retrieve(question).passages
        prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

@weave.op()
def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    answer_EM = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)
    answer_PM = dspy.evaluate.answer_passage_match(example, pred)
    return answer_EM and answer_PM


weave.init(project_name="dspy_rag")
turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo')
colbertv2_wiki17_abstracts = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')
dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo, rm=colbertv2_wiki17_abstracts)
dataset = HotPotQA(train_seed=1, train_size=20, eval_seed=2023, dev_size=50, test_size=0)
trainset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.train]
devset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.dev]
teleprompter = BootstrapFewShot(metric=validate_context_and_answer)
compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset)
```

## Create a `Model` for easier experimentation

Organizing experimentation is difficult when there are many moving pieces. By using the [`Model`](/guides/core-types/models) class, you can capture and organize the experimental details of your app like your system prompt or the model you're using. This helps organize and compare different iterations of your app. 

In addition to versioning code and capturing inputs/outputs, [`Model`](/guides/core-types/models)s capture structured parameters that control your application’s behavior, making it easy to find what parameters worked best. You can also use Weave Models with `serve`, and [`Evaluation`](/guides/core-types/evaluations)s.

In the example below, you can experiment with `WeaveModel`. Every time you change one of these, you'll get a new _version_ of `WeaveModel`.

```python
import dspy
import weave

weave.init(project_name="dspy_rag")

gpt3_turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-1106', max_tokens=300)
dspy.configure(lm=gpt3_turbo)


class CheckCitationFaithfulness(dspy.Signature):
    """Verify that the text is based on the provided context."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="facts here are assumed to be true")
    text = dspy.InputField()
    faithfulness = dspy.OutputField(desc="True/False indicating if text is faithful to context")


class WeaveModel(weave.Model):
    signature: type

    @weave.op()
    def predict(self, context: str, text: str) -> bool:
        return dspy.ChainOfThought(self.signature)(context=context, text=text)

context = "The 21-year-old made seven appearances for the Hammers and netted his only goal for them in a Europa League qualification round match against Andorran side FC Lustrains last season. Lee had two loan spells in League One last term, with Blackpool and then Colchester United. He scored twice for the U's but was unable to save them from relegation. The length of Lee's contract with the promoted Tykes has not been revealed. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page."
text = "Lee scored 3 goals for Colchester United."

model = WeaveModel(signature=CheckCitationFaithfulness)
print(model.predict(context, text))
```

### Serving a Weave Model

Given a weave reference any WeaveModel object, you can spin up a fastapi server and [serve](https://wandb.github.io/weave/guides/tools/serve) it.

|---|
| You can find the weave reference of any WeaveModel by navigating to the model and copying it from the UI. |

You can serve your model by using the following command in the terminal:

```shell
weave serve weave:///your_entity/project-name/YourModel:<hash>
```
