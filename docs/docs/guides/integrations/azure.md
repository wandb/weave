# Microsoft Azure

Weights & Biases integrates with Microsoft Azure OpenAI services, helping teams to manage, debug, and optimize their Azure AI workflows at scale. This guide introduces the W&B integration, what it means for Weave users, its key features, and how to get started.

## Key features

- **LLM evaluations**: Evaluate and monitor LLM-powered applications using Weave, optimized for Azure infrastructure.  
- **Seamless integration**: Deploy W&B Models on a dedicated Azure tenant with built-in integrations for Azure AI Studio, Azure ML, Azure OpenAI Service, and other Azure AI services.  
- **Enhanced performance**: Use Azureâ€™s infrastructure to train and deploy models faster, with auto-scaling clusters and optimized resources.  
- **Scalable experiment tracking**: Automatically log hyperparameters, metrics, and artifacts for Azure AI Studio and Azure ML runs.  
- **LLM fine-tuning**: Fine-tune models with W&B Models.
- **Central repository for models and datasets**: Manage and version models and datasets with W&B Registry and Azure AI Studio.  
- **Collaborative workspaces**: Support teamwork with shared workspaces, experiment commenting, and Microsoft Teams integration.  
- **Governance framework**: Ensure security with fine-grained access controls, audit trails, and Microsoft Entra ID integration.  

## Getting started

To use W&B with Azure, add the W&B integration via the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/weightsandbiasesinc1641502883483.weights_biases_for_azure?tab=Overview).
