# Environment variables

Weave provides a set of environment variables to configure and optimize its behavior. You can set these variables in your shell or within scripts to control specific functionality.

```bash
# Example of setting environment variables in the shell
WEAVE_PARALLELISM=10  # Controls the number of parallel workers
WEAVE_PRINT_CALL_LINK=false  # Disables call link output
```

```python
# Example of setting environment variables in Python
import os

os.environ["WEAVE_PARALLELISM"] = "10"
os.environ["WEAVE_PRINT_CALL_LINK"] = "false"
```
