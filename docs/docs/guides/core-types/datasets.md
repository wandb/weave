# Datasets

Weave `Dataset`s help you to organize, collect, track, and version examples for LLM application evaluation for easy comparison. You can create and interact with `Dataset`s programmatically and via the UI. 

This page describes:

- Basic `Dataset` operations in Python and TypeScript and how to get started  
- How to create a `Dataset` in Python and TypeScript from objects such as Weave [calls](../tracking/tracing.mdx)
- Available operations on a `Dataset` in the UI

## `Dataset` quickstart

The following code samples demonstrate how to perform fundamental `Dataset` operations using Python and TypeScript. Using the SDKs, you can:

- Create a `Dataset`
- Publish the `Dataset`
- Retrieve the `Dataset`
- Access a specific example in the `Dataset`

Select a tab to see Python and TypeScript-specific code.

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import weave
    from weave import Dataset
    # Initialize Weave
    weave.init('intro-example')

    # Create a dataset
    dataset = Dataset(
        name='grammar',
        rows=[
            {'id': '0', 'sentence': "He no likes ice cream.", 'correction': "He doesn't like ice cream."},
            {'id': '1', 'sentence': "She goed to the store.", 'correction': "She went to the store."},
            {'id': '2', 'sentence': "They plays video games all day.", 'correction': "They play video games all day."}
        ]
    )

    # Publish the dataset
    weave.publish(dataset)

    # Retrieve the dataset
    dataset_ref = weave.ref('grammar').get()

    # Access a specific example
    example_label = dataset_ref.rows[2]['sentence']
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import * as weave from 'weave';

        name: 'grammar',
        rows: [
            {id: '0', sentence: "He no likes ice cream.", correction: "He doesn't like ice cream."},

            {id: '2', sentence: "They plays video games all day.", correction: "They play video games all day."}
        ]
    });

    // Publish the dataset
    await dataset.save();

    // Access a specific example
    const exampleLabel = datasetRef.getRow(2).sentence;
    ```

## Create a `Dataset` from other objects

<Tabs groupId="programming-language" queryString>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>
  In Python, `Dataset`s can also be constructed from common Weave objects like [calls](../tracking/tracing.mdx), and Python objects like `pandas.DataFrame`s. This feature is useful if you want to create an example `Dataset` from specific examples.

  ### Weave call

  To create a `Dataset` from one or more Weave calls, retrieve the call object(s), and add them to a list in the `from_calls` method.

  ```python
  @weave.op
  def model(task: str) -> str:
      return f"Now working on {task}"

  res1, call1 = model.call(task="fetch")
  res2, call2 = model.call(task="parse")

  dataset = Dataset.from_calls([call1, call2])
  # Now you can use the dataset to evaluate the model, etc.
  ```

  ### Pandas DataFrame

  To create a `Dataset` from a Pandas `DataFrame` object, use the `from_pandas` method. 

  To convert the `Dataset` back, use `to_pandas`.

  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  df = pd.DataFrame([
      {'id': '0', 'sentence': "He no likes ice cream.", 'correction': "He doesn't like ice cream."},
      {'id': '1', 'sentence': "She goed to the store.", 'correction': "She went to the store."},
      {'id': '2', 'sentence': "They plays video games all day.", 'correction': "They play video games all day."}
  ])
  dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
  df2 = dataset.to_pandas()

  assert df.equals(df2)
  ```

   This feature is not currently available in TypeScript.  Stay tuned!

## Create, edit, and delete a `Dataset` in the UI

You can create, edit, and delete `Dataset`s in the UI.

### Create a new `Dataset`

1. Navigate to the Weave project you want to edit.

2. In the sidebar, select **Traces**.

3. Select one or more calls that you want to create a new `Dataset` for.

4. In the upper right-hand menu, click the **Add selected rows to a dataset** icon (located next to the trashcan icon).

5. From the **Choose a dataset** dropdown, select **Create new**. The **Dataset name** field appears.

6. In the **Dataset name** field, enter a name for your dataset. Options to **Configure dataset fields**  appear.

    :::important
    Dataset names must start with a letter or number and can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.
    :::

7. (Optional) In **Configure dataset fields**, select the fields from your calls to include in the dataset.  
    - You can customize the column names for each selected field.
    - You can select a subset of fields to include in the new `Dataset`, or deselect all fields.

8. Once you've configured the dataset fields, click **Next**. A preview of your new `Dataset` appears. 

9. (Optional) Click any of the editable fields in your **Dataset** to edit the entry.

10. Click **Create dataset**. Your new dataset is created.

11. In the confirmation popup, click **View the dataset** to view the new `Dataset`. Alternatively, go to the **Datasets** tab.

### Edit a `Dataset` 

1. Navigate to the Weave project containing the `Dataset` you want to edit.
