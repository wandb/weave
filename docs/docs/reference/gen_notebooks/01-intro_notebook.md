# 🏃‍♀️ Quickstart

Get started using Weave to:
- Log and debug language model inputs, outputs, and traces
- Build rigorous, apples-to-apples evaluations for language model use cases
- Organize all the information generated across the LLM workflow, from experimentation to evaluations to production

See the full Weave documentation [here](https://wandb.me/weave).


## 🪄 Install `weave` library and login


Start by installing the library and logging in to your account.

In this example, we're using openai so you should [add an openai API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key).



```python
%%capture
!pip install weave openai set-env-colab-kaggle-dotenv
```


```python
# Set your OpenAI API key
from set_env import set_env

# Put your OPENAI_API_KEY in the secrets panel to the left 🗝️
_ = set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..." # alternatively, put your key here

PROJECT = "weave-intro-notebook"
```

# Track inputs & outputs of functions

Weave allows users to track function calls: the code, inputs, outputs, and even LLM tokens & costs! In the following sections we will cover:

* Custom Functions
* Vendor Integrations
* Nested Function Calling
* Error Tracking

Note: in all cases, we will:

```python
import weave                    # import the weave library
weave.init('project-name')      # initialize tracking for a specific W&B project
```

## Track custom functions

Add the @weave.op decorator to the functions you want to track

![](../../media/intro/1.png)


```python
from openai import OpenAI

import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)

client = OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input.",
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!"},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)
generation = response.choices[0].message.content
print(generation)
```

You can find your interactive dashboard by clicking any of the  👆 wandb links above.

## Vendor Integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc...)

Here, we're automatically tracking all calls to `openai`. We automatically track a lot of LLM libraries, but it's really easy to add support for whatever LLM you're using, as you'll see below. 

![](../../media/intro/2.png)


```python
import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)


@weave.op()
def strip_user_input(user_input):
    return user_input.strip()


result = strip_user_input("    hello    ")
print(result)
```

After adding `weave.op` and calling the function, visit the link and see it tracked within your project.

💡 We automatically track your code, have a look at the code tab!

## Track nested functions

Now that you've seen the basics, let's combine all of the above and track some deeply nested functions alongside LLM calls.



![](../../media/intro/3.png)


```python
from openai import OpenAI

import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)


@weave.op()
def strip_user_input(user_input):
    return user_input.strip()


@weave.op()
def correct_grammar(user_input):
    client = OpenAI()

    stripped = strip_user_input(user_input)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": stripped},
        ],
        temperature=0,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


result = correct_grammar("   That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!    ")
print(result)
```

## Track Errors

Whenever your code crashes, weave will highlight what caused the issue. This is especially useful for finding things like JSON parsing issues that can occasionally happen when parsing data from LLM responses.

![](../../media/intro/4.png)


```python
import json

from openai import OpenAI

import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)


@weave.op()
def strip_user_input(user_input):
    return user_input.strip()


@weave.op()
def correct_grammar(user_input):
    client = OpenAI()

    stripped = strip_user_input(user_input)
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input.",
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": stripped},
        ],
        temperature=0,
        response_format={"type": "json_object"},
    )
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)


result = correct_grammar("   That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!    ")
print(result)
```

# Tracking Objects

Organizing experimentation is difficult when there are many moving pieces. You can capture and organize the experimental details of your app like your system prompt or the model you're using within `weave.Objects`. This helps organize and compare different iterations of your app. In this section, we will cover:

* General Object Tracking
* Tracking Models
* Tracking Datasets

## General Object Tracking

Many times, it is useful to track & version data, just like you track and version code. For example, here we define a `SystemPrompt(weave.Object)` object that can be shared between teammates

![](../../media/intro/5.png)


```python
import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)


class SystemPrompt(weave.Object):
    prompt: str


system_prompt = SystemPrompt(
    prompt="You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input."
)
weave.publish(system_prompt)
```

## Model Tracking

Models are so common of an object type, that we have a special class to represent them: `weave.Model`. The only requirement is that we define a `predict` method.

![](../../media/intro/6.png)


```python
from openai import OpenAI

import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)


class OpenAIGrammarCorrector(weave.Model):
    # Properties are entirely user-defined
    openai_model_name: str
    system_message: str

    @weave.op()
    def predict(self, user_input):
        client = OpenAI()
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.openai_model_name,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": self.system_message},
                {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
            ],
            temperature=0,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content


corrector = OpenAIGrammarCorrector(
    openai_model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    system_message="You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input.",
)

result = corrector.predict("     That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!       ")
print(result)
```

## Dataset Tracking

Similar to models, a `weave.Dataset` object exists to help track, organize, and operate on datasets

![](../../media/intro/7.png)


```python
dataset = weave.Dataset(
    name="grammar-correction",
    rows=[
        {
            "user_input": "   That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!   ",
            "expected": "That was so easy, it was a piece of cake!",
        },
        {"user_input": "  I write good   ", "expected": "I write well"},
        {
            "user_input": "  GPT-3 is smartest AI model.   ",
            "expected": "GPT-3 is the smartest AI model.",
        },
    ],
)

weave.publish(dataset)
```

Notice that we saved a versioned `GrammarCorrector` object that captures the configurations you're experimenting with.

## Retrieve Published Objects & Ops

You can publish objects and then retrieve them in your code. You can even call functions from your retrieved objects!

![](../../media/intro/8.png)


```python
import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)

corrector = OpenAIGrammarCorrector(
    openai_model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",
    system_message="You are a grammar checker, correct the following user input.",
)

ref = weave.publish(corrector)
print(ref.uri())
```

![](../../media/intro/9.png)


```python
import weave

weave.init(PROJECT)

# Note: this url is available from the UI after publishing the object!
ref_url = f"weave:///{ref.entity}/{PROJECT}/object/{ref.name}:{ref.digest}"
fetched_collector = weave.ref(ref_url).get()

# Notice: this object was loaded from remote location!
result = fetched_collector.predict("That was so easy, it was a piece of pie!")

print(result)
```

# Evaluation

Evaluation-driven development helps you reliably iterate on an application. The `Evaluation` class is designed to assess the performance of a `Model` on a given `Dataset` or set of examples using scoring functions.

See a preview of the API below:

![](../../media/intro/10.png)


```python
import weave
from weave import Evaluation


# Define any custom scoring function
@weave.op()
def exact_match(expected: str, model_output: dict) -> dict:
    # Here is where you'd define the logic to score the model output
    return {"match": expected == model_output}


# Score your examples using scoring functions
evaluation = Evaluation(
    dataset=dataset,  # can be a list of dictionaries or a weave.Dataset object
    scorers=[exact_match],  # can be a list of scoring functions
)

# Start tracking the evaluation
weave.init(PROJECT)
# Run the evaluation
summary = await evaluation.evaluate(corrector)  # can be a model or simple function
```
