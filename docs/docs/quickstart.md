# Quickstart

## Installation

`pip install weave`

## Track inputs & outputs of functions

- Import weave
- Call `weave.init('project-name')` to start logging
- Add the `@weave.op()` decorator to the functions you want to track

```python
# highlight-next-line
import weave
from openai import OpenAI

# highlight-next-line
@weave.op()
def correct_grammar(sentence: str) -> str:
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You will be provided with statements, and your task is to convert them to standard English." },
            {"role": "user", "content": sentence}],
        temperature=0.7,
        max_tokens=64,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# highlight-next-line
weave.init('intro-example')
correct_grammar('she no went to the market')
```

Now, every time you call this function, weave will automatically capture the input & output data and log any changes to the code. 
Run this application and your console will output a link to view it within W&B.

:::note
Calls made with the openai library are automatically tracked with weave but you can add other LLMs easily by wrapping them with `@weave.op()`
