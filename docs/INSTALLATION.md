# Weave Installation Guide

## Setup

Make sure you have a python environment running at least python 3.9. We recommend using `pyenv` to manage python environments. Next, install Weave directly from PyPi using `pip install weave`.

### Ecosystem

There are many _experimental_ packages in the `ecosystem` directory. To ensure you have all the required dependencies, install with `pip install weave[ecosystem]`
