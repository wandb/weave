1. Always include docstrings when writing functions.
2. Short or otherwise obvious functions can have a 1-line docstring.
3. Use Google-style docstrings.  See below for an example:

```python
def function(param1: str, param2: float) -> bool:
    """
    Short description of what the function does at the top.

    Args:
        param1 (str): This is the first param.
        param2 (float): This is a second param.

    Returns:
        bool: This is a description of what is returned.

    Raises:
        KeyError: Raises an exception.
    """
    ...
```
