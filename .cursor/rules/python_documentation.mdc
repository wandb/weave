1. When writing functions, always include Google-style docstrings with examples.  Short or otherwise obvious functions can have a 1-line docstring.  See below for an example.

```python
def function(param1: str, param2: float) -> bool:
    """
    Short description of what the function does at the top.

    Args:
        param1 (str): This is the first param.
        param2 (float): This is a second param.

    Returns:
        bool: This is a description of what is returned.

    Raises:
        KeyError: Raises an exception.

    Examples:
        Examples should be be written in doctest format, and should illustrate how
        to use the function.

    """
    ...
```
