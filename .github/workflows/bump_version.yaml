name: bump-python-sdk-version

# This workflow is used to bump the version of the Weave Python SDK.
# It will take 2 steps:
# 1. Drop the pre-release tag and push a new commit to the main branch.
# 2. Bump the version to the next pre-release version and push a new commit to the main branch.
#
# see weave/version.py for more details on the versioning scheme.
