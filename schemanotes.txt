TODO After:
* Document and organize SQL
* Make sure sqllite is aligned
* Run test suite against trace server
* Remove `_result` from output (and re-type as `any` - more precisely - any jsonable)
* recursively pull out refs from values
* Should add `x_refs` to any value dumps field (call_parts.inputs, call_parts.output, objects.val, table_rows.val)
